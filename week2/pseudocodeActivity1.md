Writing Pseudocode
==================

10 friends are sitting in a circle around a table and decide to play a new game. In it, they count up through the numbers from 1 to 100. The first person says "1", the second says "2" and so on... but with a few catches:

Whenever the number is divisible by 7, they switch directions. So person 6 will say "6", person 7 will say "7", then person 6 again will say "8".
Whenever the number is divisible by 11, they skip the next person.
Your job is to pseudocode a program which will determine which player says the number 100. For this one, be as specific as possible to actually write out the logic of the procedure.
